This is our 18th Annual AOH Polar Plunge For Catholic Education.  The Ancient Order of Hibernians is the oldest and largest Irish Catholic organization in the United States.   We live the Motto of Friendship, Unity and Christian Charity.

PRE-CAROUSEL

POST-CAROUSEL 

This year the event should exceed $2,000,000 in collections over the 18 year period.  We are very proud to say 100% of the money raised has been retained by the school that raised it.   The Ancient Order of HIbernians fundraises for the event to pay for Police, Fire, First Aid, Water Rescue, Insurance and all of the costs associated with running a Polar Plunge.   Each year that fundraising exceeds $5,000.00.  As a result the schools come for free and keep their money to help children attend their school or improve their infrastructure.

Every year 500 to 1000 students, teachers, clergy, parents, family and friends jump in the cold water to help their schools.   Jumping in includes dipping your toe, going in to their ankles, knees, waist or for the brave headfirst.  Land lovers to Polar Bears can enjoy the event and support their school.

Come join us in the Atlantic Ocean as we cross the $2,000,000 mark!
